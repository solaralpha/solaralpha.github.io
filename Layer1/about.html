  <p><h2>It is one of our core beliefs to leave the world better than we found it, no matter the size of our contribution.</h2>
    <br></br>
     It has, for the longest time, been the norm for education software to either
     come packaged with too little, or be loaded with many common errors and bugs
     that are not expected in software in any other field. At the time of my
     writing this, all these originally small and usually insignificant errors
     have been amplified by a county-wide quarantine.
   <br></br>
     On more than just one occasion have the students in my school had to request
     extensions to projects they completed just because they unknowingly turned
     it in sideways. On more than one occasion has our district had to turn to
     third-party solutions outside of what they pay for already, not to mention
     the bugs that are incurred through it.
   <br></br>
     Because of the number of issues facing us so far, we knew what our task was:
     to either create software usable by school districts, or to create competition
     for the current norm to force it to improve.
